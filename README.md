## IP66-Enclosure-for-IoT-Device

#### This project was developed to meet the requirements of an IP66-rated enclosure suitable for outdoor IoT devices operating in remote environments.

#### Design Objectives:
#### IP66 Compliance: The enclosure is sealed against dust and high-pressure water jets, with rubber gaskets and sealed cable glands at all interfaces.
#### Manufacturability: Designed for injection molding (plastic).
#### Sealed Cable Entry: Includes power and signal input cable entries with IP66-rated sealing using standard M12 cable glands.
#### Fastener Standards: All fasteners are DIN standard, and their type, size, quantity, and positioning are clearly defined to maintain ingress protection during assembly
#### For evaluation of the project, there are two different formats of CAD files "Enclosure_Box_IP66_IoT.f3d" and "Enclosure_Box_IP66_IoT.step".
