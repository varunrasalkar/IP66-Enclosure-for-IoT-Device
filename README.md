# IP66-Enclosure-for-IoT-Device

This project was developed to meet the requirements of an IP66-rated enclosure suitable for outdoor IoT devices operating in remote environments.

Design Objectives:
IP66 Compliance: The enclosure is sealed against dust and high-pressure water jets, with rubber gaskets and sealed cable glands at all interfaces.
Manufacturability: Designed for injection molding (plastic).
Sealed Cable Entry: Includes power and signal input cable entries with IP66-rated sealing using standard M12 cable glands.
Fastener Standards: All fasteners are DIN standard, and their type, size, quantity, and positioning are clearly defined to maintain ingress protection during assembly
